## Project Description

Me Mantra is designed to help people improve their lives in real time by combining the power of mantras with evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques. While many self-help books and gurus share powerful ideas, enthusiasm often fades quickly and lasting change rarely follows. Me Mantra is different because it works in the moment.

Repeating a mantra three or more times takes only seconds, yet it taps into cognitive behavioral techniques that can interrupt deeply ingrained, unhelpful thought patterns. Unlike generic daily affirmations, Me Mantra provides:

- **Deeper Connection** – Each mantra includes background explanations and examples, helping users engage with the meaning behind the words and increasing its impact
- **Simplified CBT** – Complex evidence-based CBT strategies are simplified into memorable mantras while still explaining the theory and practical application

### Example Mantra
> **Confidence is about recognizing what might go right. So—what might go right?**
> 
> *"Gaining confidence is not about denying what could go wrong. It's about recognizing what might go right."* – Dr. Adam Grant

### Core Features 
- Library of mantras with background explanations and CBT foundations
- Categorization and tagging system for easy mantra discovery
- User accounts with personal profiles and collections
- Mobile app for on-the-go access
- Push notifications with smart scheduling and triggers
- Personalized recommendations based on user preferences and history
